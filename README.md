# CONSTRUCTIVIST // PROTOTYPE

"Constructivist" not as a tool,
but as a prototype.

A machine for abstraction. An interface for emergence.

Not made for target groups – but for the play of form.

Some instances are precise. Others are glitchy. Some break.

But each one is a step in the process: design as a mode of thought, as memetics, as system.

The goal? No product. No solution. No trend. Just a proposal for synthetic design.

A tool that asks more than it solves.
A tool that generates form instead of storing it.
